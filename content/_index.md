# Project Management 

This part of the Msc Subject is focused on learning how to manage an ICT project. Indeed, we will focus on the following aspects: 

1. Define requirements based on an idea (Focus Group)
2. Presentation of Agile Methodology
3. Appliation of Scrum
4. Learn how to make presentation.

We hope you enjoy the subject and the PBL methodology in order to cover all the "start-up" generation starting from generating an idea, implementing it, try to get funding and finally expose it to the customers and product launch.
