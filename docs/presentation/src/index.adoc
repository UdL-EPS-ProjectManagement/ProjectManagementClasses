== Too Much Text in the slides

We could make a presentation with lot of text in each slide. This makes rendering sentence difficult. So, we probably need to cut some of the sentences to make it readable. The effect is even worst with bullet points:

[.list,build=items]
* Point A
* Point B
* Point C
