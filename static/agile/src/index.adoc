After defining and viewing the different software development methods. Now, it is time to
introduce and detail the agile methodology.

[.slide-agenda-title]
== Agile Methodology Begins

Agile is a software methodology based on the production models of Toyota and Canyon. For this reason,

"*Lean Manufacturing* uses the minimun necessary resources, 
 removing all wastes and maximising the product value. "
-- Toyota

[.cue]

Lean manufacturing is about using the necessary resources to build a product. For that, we need to 
avoid wasting times, reduce the inventories, improve efficiency and continous improvement 
to increase product quality.

The concept of lean manufacturing could be applied to software development. In this case, the main 
principles could directly extrapolated: 
- Reduce code defects (Bugs)
- Adjust the functionalities of the product. 
- Reduce no productive tasks (documentation)
- Optimise the work and the time to work.

The first problem to deal with is referring the velocity to create newer products. This implies the 
companies to make the production and development of new products in shorter periods of time.

Another important aspect is the uncertainty of the market. The companies has been forced to create a 
variety of products to cover as much markets as possible. Today, the companies needs to life from a 
variety of products to survive.

[.slide-title-top]
== Agile Manifesto - 4 Values
image::manifesto-values.jpeg[Agile Manifesto values,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The agile manifesto establishes the main rules of the agile methodology. The first important aspects 
refert to the 4 values: 
- *People Interaction*. Agile strength is in the team interaction and customer interation in 
order to build the product. It is important bidirectional communication with the client. At same time, 
the interacton between the development team is important to advance in the product development. 
- *Functional Prototypes*. Important aspect of agile is to have always a functional software to show to 
the client. Over this initial software new functionalities/requirements appear and then, new aspects to 
improve the product should be developed. 
- *Customer Involvement*. The developmet is focused on the user (client). Based on them, the product is
constructed and for this reason, it is important a close relation with the customer. 
- *Response Change*. Refers to the hability to add7remove requirements and functionalities without impacting
in the product costs.
